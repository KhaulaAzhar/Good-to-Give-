      <h1>Orphanages:</h1>
      <h4>"We care for orphan not because we are rescures,but because we are the rescued"<br> -David platt</h4>
      <p> Orphans hold a special place in the hearts of humanitarians. By their nature, children are vulnerable.The loss of a guardian<br> leads to loss in opportunities, resources and much-needed support.Children who lose one or more parent <br>often miss school, struggle with food insecurity and lack proper clothing.<br>If you also believe that orphans have as much as right to life-sustaining resources<br> as children with both parents, then donate generously to our orphan support fund.
      Without the generous financial contributions from donors like you,<br> we would not be able to provide the food, clothing, shelter and other support to orphans in need around the world.
      <br>Below are orphanages button link projects you can support.</p>

      <h4>"Old age is not a disease - it is strength an survivorship, triumph over all kinds of <br>vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illness."<br> - Maggie Kuhn.</h4>
      <p>With each decade of life, we learn, we grow, we struggle, and hopefully, we triumph. By the time we reach an old age, <br>chances are we’re pretty doggone resilient. Not so resilient, though, that we never<br> need a helping hand.Old age is an unavoidable part of our life cycle and should be lived gracefully rather than grudgingly.<br> The purpose of life is a life of purpose.So start donating now for the special cause:
